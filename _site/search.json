    "text": "TL;DR I gave a presentation on Missing Narratives around Diversity and Inclusion in Research Software Engineering. My report on LGBTQ scientists who code (jobs that have “Developer’’, “Data”, “Software”, etc. in Twitter description) show that within the MiR Twitter followers with a pride flag account for 2.52%, and the followers of TheStemVillage Twitter account make up 2.05% (n= 486).\n\n\nAs a fairly new R coder but has been coding in Python for years, I have often assumed that there were no LGBTQ programmers in the world, especially professionals. In my experience in Python, there was no representation, no out of the closet coder (including YouTuber), no pride flag or colours in any visible way in my years typing code for me to know that someone like me exists prior to 2020. This changed when I went to Python’s PyCascades 2020 online Conference event and for the first time I saw someone who was a LGBTQ programmer and a professional. Even more exciting was that this person was also Transgender, which is huge news for me, as often Transgender Women (especially Black Trans Women) are often in sad and tragic stories. This revelation made me see that people like me exist, the issue being a lack of awareness and visibility on top of socioeconomic reasons in the job market.\nSoon after I started to find the joy in coding in R and saw that Minorities in R group exists, I joined the MiR community. My experience within the R community has been a blessing on many fronts, in short, it is a very welcoming and kind community where LGBTQ people are open and very much accepted. When an opportunity in the R group Forwards to give a presentation on diversity and inclusion topic, I knew what had to be done, find fellow LGBTQ coders who are open on Twitter and make this my data science project.\n\n\n\nFinding LGBTQ people by pride emoji in Twitter names and biography sections is fairly straightforward, but in this process there is LGBTQ Allies who have the pride flag who get initially counted when scrolling quickly through accounts. The second process was to screen out those with ‘Ally’ and a pride flag emoji, and accounts with pride flags but no job or title associated with the name (which is a frequent occurrence). Accounts with pronouns such as ‘They/Them’, pride flags such as the Trans pride flag were included, any account with ‘They/Them’ were counted as Transgender regardless if it was stated.\nWhere to start looking was a matter of quick selection and convenience of accounts I follow who were in my Twitter timeline. The MiR Twitter account has (as of Sept 15, 2021) 1425 followers and was the obvious first choice as all members are coders even if not their primary discipline or job. Out of these Twitter followers, 36 accounts met the criteria, which is 2.52% of the community. Upon seeing the small percentage of LGBTQ users in the MiR group, it is within reason that many are also not visible on Twitter, and this data could be missing people, as the racial minorities are after all, minorities within the R community which is mostly used in academia (another factor of LGBTQ and racial minority level).\nThe second Twitter account I searched was TheSTEMvillage for two reasons; it has a large Twitter following of 6683 accounts (as of Sept 15, 2021), and STEM is encompassing to who would be counted in the inclusion criteria. My initial idea was to use the rtweet package and scrape the data but the data I was after is not collected, which is odd considering Twitter gives you so much data on a single Tweet or user. \nGoing through so many accounts by hand was not super fun but did allow for proper screening of accounts and further inspection. My first collection had 580 accounts, then the second screen deleted 94 accounts for incomplete data, resulting in a sample size of 486 accounts.\nThe data showed what fields LGBTQ STEM scientists largely fall into, which is important data as the R community has many interdisciplinary academic fields and users. My burning question remained as to where are the Transgender scientists and in what field do they go into, as 99 accounts were counted as Transgender (20.37%). \nInteresting to find that those accounts counted as Transgender largely work in the Neuroscience field. Anecdotal evidence of my Twitter of who I follow, my awareness of Transgender people often work in Software Game Development and fewer in the Data Science field.\nOne might be asking why I did not include the WomenWhoCode Twitter account, an account that has over 200,000 followers. I did look at their followers, as I was parsing through the followers for an hour, I only counted less than 5 that met the inclusion criteria. As stated above, using the Twitter API would be no help in the task of finding LGBTQ coders in this group.\nNotes: - The dataset I curated has engineers of various fields as engineers and similar imperfect lumping scientists into discrete groups despite the variability of the field of science they are a part of. - TheSTEMvillage Twitter account and followers are largely in the UK and where most of the accounts work\n\n\n\nThis was a learning and exploratory project for me, as I did not know where or how many LGBTQ scientists there are as they often do not make it on the mainstream media. The main insight from this project is that I am not alone, LGBTQ people are in various fields of science, and are minorities in a world of binaries in terms of genders, sexualities and the datasets we use. By sharing my work I hope this helps others and to inspire similar works, all in the aim of getting LGBTQ youth interested and involved in science, representation matters and being counted is part of the visibility."

    "text": "✨ Yanina Noemí Bellini Saibene (she/her)\n\n\nWhat is your current role?\nI have a lot of hats but the job that pays the bills is as Research at National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) coordinating the Agroecosystem Modeling Network and professor at Universidad Nacional Guillermo Brown (UNAB). I’m also a member of The Carpentries Executive Council by the vote of the community since 2022.\n\n\nTell us about yourself!\nI live with my husband and my two beautiful children in Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina, in South America. I am a scientist. I build digital solutions for the agricultural sector. That is why I’m chair (since 2016) for the AgroInformatics congress in Argentina and I’m chair of the Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operational Research (JAIIO) during 2020 and 2021.\nI am the first generation in my family to complete high school. I won two scholarships at my job, which allowed me to finish my undergrad degree in information systems and a master’s degree in Data Mining. I’m also an RStudio Certified Trainer and a The Carpentries Instructor and Trainer.\nI had to work from an early age. I started teaching programming when I was 15 and never stopped. I love teaching because education is one of the few tools that people like I, in countries like mine, have to improve our lives. Especially because it is essential to narrow the structural inequalities in our society. This is why, during the pandemic, I co-founded MetaDocencia (https://www.metadocencia.org/), an organization to expand good teaching practices to Spanish-speaking teachers, we teach to more than 2000 teachers from 30 countries. It is also one of the reasons I have to love communities of practice such as R-Ladies were I can share and teach what I know for free. I also teach to industries, the public sector, and universities about R and AgTech.\nI became part of the R Community 3 years ago when I started the R-Ladies Santa Rosa Chapter, now I am part of the R-Ladies Global and Leadership Team. I am a co-founder and co-chair of LatinR, a trilingual conference about R in Latin America and I was one of the global coordinator of useR! 2021 .\nAs language is an important barrier in my region, I’m part of severals teams that translates R material into Spanish such as R for Data Science, RStudio Cheat Sheet and other books as Teaching Teach Together and R-Ladies documents. I’m also maintaining the Spanish version of https://www.learnr4free.com/\nI relate my work at INTA with my work at the R Community by seeking to make my science as reproducible and open as possible using open computing tools. I use a lot of spatial data and some Data Mining techniques to analyze information from weather radar, satellite images, and drones. I use R and Python for this task. I also give many talks telling what we do at INTA and how I use data science in my work.”\n\n\nWhat are the most important skills in your current position? How did you develop these skills?\nRegarding the research I do programming, wrangling data and modeling are the most important skills.\nAs I am the head of a research group, linking with other institutions and reasearch groups is also essential, the search for funds, the communication of our results and progress and the management of human resources.\nAs a teacher, how to teach online has been a highly relevant skill in this pandemic.\nFor the first one my undergrad and master programm give me the skills that I need together with 24 years being a Research at INTA.\nFor the second one only the 23 years of experience being a Research at INTA. So I made a lot of mistakes in the process of become a good leader. For the third the international R Community help me a lot with that and the RStudio/The Carpentries Certification.\n\n\nWhat are some difficulties you’ve faced in your career? How did you overcome them?\nSince I belong to a low-income family, being able to study was always a challenge, especially since I also had to work. For example, my family moved to a city where the public university was so I could study. The class schedules at university didn’t allow me to work, so I ended up studying in another institution where classes were at night and allow me to work. It takes me more time than the rest finish my studies because of the work (I start my day at 6.30 and ended at 23.30), but I become the best student with the highest grades. :-)\nBeing a woman in a career and a job where the majority were men has given me many stories to tell, some of them not very funny.\nBecoming a mother has also been a challenge as a scientist and teacher. In my case, my children were desired and they are the best thing that has ever happened to me. The career is affected by this new role because the system does not take into account a mother researcher. In general, it is very hard if everything goes well. In my case, my first pregnancy was very complicated, it ended with the birth of my daughter Ana and her death a few days after her birth. It was very hard and had a huge impact on my career for several years.\nAt the international level language and the stereotype of the Latin American woman has also been a difficulty. It is very hard for many people to understand the problems faced by people who live in developing countries. Especially prejudices about our ability to work and our level of intelligence.\nThese difficulties overcome with a lot of work, study and patience, knowing how to choose which fight to give and which not. Knowing how to choose with whom to work (in case you can choose) and to whom to dedicate your time. Knowing our limitations and our own privileges. Helping those who come behind. Knowing and accepting the value that we all have as people and as trained professionals.\nIt sounds simple when writing, it is quite complicated when it must be done. Especially since it is almost always the person with the disadvantage who must do the hard work to make these barrier noticeable and make it disappear.\n\n\nLooking back on your career, what advice do you wish someone had given you that would have helped accelerate your career? (or generally, provided you with a better experience)\nThat you should not regret missing some opportunities because at some point others will appear. Especially if taking those opportunities means working with people you are not comfortable with or accepting unfair working conditions. Again easy to said, hard to do, because some times you can’t choose.\n\n\nWhat are some specific resources that helped you in your journey of learning and using R?\n\nR-Ladies Meetups (https://yabellini.shinyapps.io/RLadiesLesson/)\nR4DS en Español (https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/)\nRStudio Education (https://education.rstudio.com/)\nLearnR4Free (https://www.learnr4free.com/)\n\n\n\nDo you have any favorite R packages?\nAll the tidyverse, the rmarkdown family and the learnr package for making tutorials. I’m still learning to handle spatial data in R (I’m more a Python-QGIS person in that field).\n\n\nHow can the MiR Community best support you?\nContinue with the beautiful work you are doing building a safe space where everyone can talk and express.\n\n\nWhere can we find you on social media?\nTwitter : @@yabellini\nThanks for being apart of MiR and sharing your story with us!

    "title": "MiR Community Highlight: Andy Murtha",
    "section": "✨ Andy Murtha (He/Him/They)",
    "text": "✨ Andy Murtha (He/Him/They)\n\n\nWhat is your current role?\nManager, Decision Analytics (Test & Learn)\n\n\nTell us about yourself!\nLived in Georgia (USA) for most of my life, went to the University of Georgia and Georgia State University for my Bachelors (economics) and Masters (accounting) degrees. started my professional career in Banking and Financial Advisory services throughout most of my 20’s. Wanted a career change at 30 and went back to school for my Masters degree while working in a couple billing analyst jobs in that timeframe. After graduating from grad school, I landed a job with Deloitte in their advisory group. One of my many, many majors in my undergrad was programming, so they asked if I wanted to take a shot at analytics, and I said OK. Hence started my analytics career in my 30’s with Deloitte, SunTrust Bank (now Truist) within the audit analytics group, and currently at The Home Depot working within the Decision Analytics team.\nAt work, I am currently working on projects that involve various business partners wanting to test out ideas in a small subset of stores to see whether their idea works when compared to stores not making changes. We measure their performance relative to the baseline stores to provide insight on whether their idea is better than the status quo. For my personal projects, I am working on the following: RStudio Certified Instructor designation, some of the Shiny courses that business-science.io offers (shoutout to Matt Dancho and his team for their course content), creating R content for training purposes, and starting to work on a shiny project within Google Cloud Platform (cloud provider I am famiilar with). Future projects hopefully will include some use of the distill or blogdown packages to make a personal website to promote and share things i am working on, and topics that I care about in analytics, data science, data visualization, and R.\nI love to talk about data visualization, storytelling, accessibility in data viz and programming, and finally promoting all things R! One of my more memorable small projects included using the US Social Security Administration’s baby names database to assist in naming both my first and second child. While we did not end up using any specific name in either choice, it helped to carve out a lot of names that we didn’t want, like trying to make sure our child’s name was not currently popular in the years prior to their birth.\n\n\nWhat are the most important skills in your current position? How did you develop these skills?\nData Analysis: learned on the job, other than the business-science.io and DataCamp certifications I have, I have no formalized education in data analysis. While there is a growing trend to take analytics/data science graduates, I feel that one can still lean on self learning with a portfolio of projects to show your capability, while also sharing what you are passionate about.\nData Science: currently learning data science pipeline topics through training, also good to have general knowledge when partnering with those who already specialize in data science.\nCommunication: One of the most important skills!!! Making sure that you communicate, and also allowing time for your co-workers, business partners, and others to communicate with you! I was once told you have two ears and one mouth, listen twice as much as you speak, and that holds true in business and the community.\nProject Management: Again, no formal training here, learned on the job, but very important, no matter how large or small the project is. Project management software is out there as well to assist where needed. However, just having the basic knowledge on project management from free online resources goes a long way.\nBe curious and think skeptically: Really got good at this working for an analytics team within Internal Audit at SunTrust Bank. The more you ask questions, as well as having a healthy skepticism to question things when necessary goes a long way in both work and personal life.\n\n\nWhat are some difficulties you’ve faced in your career? How did you overcome them?\nWorking in management while still having analyst responsibilities. Basically being the analyst and project manager at the same time with no direct reports. This caused pains when it came to project management and prioritization. Something I am still working on, but what has helped a lot is to:\n\nFocus on what your goals are, and what priority those goals are in. If you can tie your professional or personal work back to those goals, along with their priority, this can get you 80% of the way there. If that work does not tie to those goals then you can prioritize them in the following.\nDelegate/Delay/Don’t Do - Try to use any or all of these options when you have a personal or work situation where you have limited bandwidth but things still need to get done\nBe very transparent with expectations with whom you are working with. If their work isn’t high priority, let them know. If you have competing priorities, let them know. If there is a possibility that deadlines might need to be moved, let them know now! Again this goes a long way in your personal life as well.\n\n\n\nLooking back on your career, what advice do you wish someone had given you that would have helped accelerate your career? (or generally, provided you with a better experience)\n\nIt’s not a race, go at your own pace. It’s funny that I figured this out very early in my personal life, but have just figured this out in my work career. As I rebooted my career in my 30’s, there are people I know my age that are directors and senior directors. As such I feel like I have been trying to catch up ever since I got into this career, instead of going at my own pace.\nThink long and hard about what you want out of work and life, and then try to find the people, places, and jobs that fit within that. This is not to say chase after a dream job, but rather, life is too short to trying to fit into a work/personal lifestyle that does not fit your goals/values/ambitions.\n\n\n\nWhat are some specific resources that helped you in your journey of learning and using R?\n\nBooks: R for Data Science\nVideos: Tidy Tuesday on YouTube, Danielle Navarro on YouTube\nLearning: DataCamp, Business-Science.io\nOnline: tidyverse.org, putrinprod.com\nOther Resources: R-Ladies Philly\nGroups ATLyTICS (non-profit analytics group n Atlanta, GA, USA)\n\n\n\nDo you have any favorite R packages?\nAll things tidyverse, tiktok, rstudioapi, tcltk2, and api packages to open source data, there are probably more, but these are ones I use consistently.\n\n\nHow can the MiR Community best support you?\nContinue to provide visibility to what others are doing in the MiR community and how we can help contribute!\n\n\nWhere can we find you on social media?\n\nTwitter: @murtha_andy\nGitHub: @amurtha80\n\nThanks for being apart of MiR and sharing your story with us! We really appreciate it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Most participants in the study groups have at least completed the training course, which at this time has currently been put on hold. If anyone has already completed the training course, they are allowed to continue working through the rest of the certification process. Additionally, there is another organization called Data Carpentry that has their own instructor training program that you can sign up to participate in and obtain a “Carpentries Instructor Badge”.\nThere have been two instructor training groups that the MiR Community has hosted, one of which is currently ongoing. The group is diverse across many aspects. Participants come from different continents, industries, and fields of study. The group is also diverse with respect to race, gender, and stage in the certification process. This diversity has been beneficial as it has allowed us to get exposed to different views, knowledge and experience, datasets, applications, and teaching styles. The current group normally meets bi-weekly, and has changed their cadence as schedules change. The group is fairly flexible, and if most participants cannot join, they will reschedule to a following week.\nIn addition to the regularly scheduled meetings, the team has the ability to continue conversations on the r-studio-instructor-training slack channel within the MiR Community Slack page. There currently has not been a shiny focused study group, however if there is an interest by a number of members, feel free to chime in and create an additional group. Additionally, while we are happy to take on more members that are working through the tidyverse certification, if you would like to create your own cohort, feel free to do so.\nThe current cohort has a running Google Document that contains topics that have been presented, practice exams that have been covered, and links to any content generated by the group. Any meeting that were content focused usually had one member create content and a presentation regarding a topic for the certification (teaching concepts, tidyverse topics). This allows members to become more familiar with the topics covered in the practical examination, as well as allowing opportunities for presenting and practicing delivering content that would occur during the teaching exam. One of the coolest things with members presenting is that they provide tips and tricks that helped them to learn the topic(s), roadblocks and common pitfalls, mnemonic devices, and other resources they found relevant beyond the books as reference material. Each member tries to rotate throughout the group so that no one person is contributing every two weeks. Based on the current member group, the rotation to contribute is about every 2 months.\nThe groups provide friendly, safe environments where it is easy to ask questions, express opinions, and troubleshoot content. Furthermore, members have the flexibility to create RMarkdown documents, present interactively in the R console, or leverage the xaringan package to create sides. Members have also published their content to GitHub or Netlify to share on the internet. Additional content covered includes materials related to the instructor training course and sample exam questions published by RStudio.\nAnother benefit to participating with the study group is the ability to demo your teaching presentation prior to taking the teaching exam, and solicit feedback from the group. This also benefits the group as it allows other members to get different takes on content delivery, a safe, inclusive environment to present content and various approaches to teaching.\nThe current cohort has volunteered to stay on and continue to participate in training conversations, as well as post certification topics and shared resources for certified RStudio Instructors. Please feel free to join our current cohort, or band together with a new group of individuals and create a new cohort of your own!"
